Time plays tricks on our minds. 

Remember how summer vacations back in childhood felt endless? A single day felt like week. 

Now, years are flying by like months. Monday starts and Friday ends like a stack of dominoes. Despise the fact that the week just disappears.

## Time Perception

Time doesn't play tricks on our brain. It, in fact, is the brain. 

It always have been the brain.

### The Science behind it

The brain measures time by recording new experiences. 

As a kid, all experiences were new. We were getting acquainted with new experiences, feelings and emotions. Our brain was constantly recording these and making time slower.

On the other hand, as an adult, everything becomes a blur to the brain.

Same breakfast, same commute, same work, same people, same netflix shows, same routine. 

Our brain skips recording these moments, making the time feel fast.

This is called Time Blindness.

### How to hack Time Blindness

Ever felt that you are on vacation and it feels like you have been away from home for much longer? 

New experiences help refactor our Unit of Time. 

Speak to new people at work. Take a different route. Meet with an old friend. 

Learn a new skill every month. 

Travel. Go on One Day Trips.

Each new experience will force our brain to pay attention — Making time expand again.

"I should do it someday."

Stop using someday. It tricks our brain into thinking that we have all the time in the world. 

That time is infinite. 

In reality, 70 years down the line, people on their deathbed say — "Life is short."
