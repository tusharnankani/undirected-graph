### Context

This is a log for a few of my thought experiments. These include my reflections and my learnings around it.

This will also have a few micro-decisions (both design decisions and logisitics) that I am proud about. 

## Thought experiments

- Wearing an analog watch to reduce my screen time 
- Stabilizing/Normalizing the extremes of my feelings

## Design Decisions

- Hacks'22 Water Bottle Size and Dispenser
- Hacks'23 Water Bottles
- OTC MeetUp's Paper Cups Reuse
- Indoor plants to judges of Hacks'23 instead of Mementos
