### Context

This is a log for a few of my thought experiments. These include my reflections and my learnings around it.

This will also have a few micro-decisions (both design decisions and logisitics) that I am proud about. 

## Design Decisions

**Hacks'22 Water Bottles**

I was a part of TSEC CodeCell, a college committee. In TSEC Hacks'23 (Our Annual Hackathon), we were planning and thinking ahead-of-time for logisitics and other requirements. Water was one of them.

The mainstream solution had been putting a multiple 20 litres can of dispensers with Plastic/Paper Cups on the side.

Looking at this felt so enviromentally wrong and logically flawed. Environmentally wrong because of obvious reasons. Logivally flawed, because a person at an average will drink at least 8 to 10 times in a day.

We decided not to have Paper Cups altogether. Three things take place here — 

- Cost Savings
- Reduction of Waste
- Waste Management, on-day logistically.

We decided to email and remind participants to carry Water Bottles (and other important belongings) along with the Problem Statements Release one night before. Everyone was bound to read it.

However, we also had a fallback plan — plastic water bottles. No, not those little ones that do not quench your thirst. Probably a worse decision than paper cups.

We chose the 500 ML (half litre) bottles. Those are better quality and can be reused for at least a day.

Gladly, aa lot of people showed up without the need to use these bottles. Hence, we instead utilized them with Mentors, Teachers and External Judges. Reuse 101.

- Hacks'23 Optimization

After seeing the response last time, we removed the dispensers and the fallback plan altogether. And the hackathon still worked out just as good.

Just because we have money and resources, doesn't mean we have to exploit them. 

The event success, the number of participation and the quality of projects may define the success metrics of a 
Hackathon. But, these micro-decisions make me, at an individual scale, feel content and fulfilled. This is how I might define my success metrics. 

**Indoor plants to judges of Hacks'23**

Thinking about this still makes me spark up and feel proud.

We were going through to continue our discussion for ahead-of-time planning and thinking about things that could go wrong. I know that it is not possible to pan out every move on the chessboard. 

However, it is a good practice to know what are the potential things that can go wrong and eventually be prepared for "Plan B"s. It is good to be aware of your surroundings and situations to take prompt but logical decisions.

Let's get back to the story. 

We hand out a tokens of appreciation and gratitude to our Judges. The mainstream solution here was printing and giving out mementos. As usual, it was suggested out in the open.

My reflex response to this was — "Let's do indoor plants."

Plants (and books) are so meaningful and thoughtful gifts in my opinion. There is growth and nurturing of both — the plants and your knowledge. And you should surround yourself with growth.

For some reason, there was a miscommunication and someone thought we are doing one of those expensive bouqets. Sorry (not sorry) but bouqets are such a waste.

Bouqets just look good and eventually end up dying in a few days. A classic example of superficial and shiny thing. Like swags or CTC. Eventually none of it is going to last; but how you felt about certain things and experiences.

I went to a plant nursery and looked for indoor plants. After discussing a few options, we got the [Jade Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassula_ovata). We also purchased different kinds of pots and placed the saplings in them. 



This picture makes me so happy and contnent. 

Ironically, the total cost turned out to be much lesser than mementos or those bouqets. Plus the satisfaction of doing this and definitely a unique and a thoughtful way to appreciate and express gratitude.

It was a win-win.
