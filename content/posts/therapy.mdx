### Context

I had my first therapy session last week. The reason I reached out is because I needed help navigating at work. 

While I knew I needed help, I tried my best to "fix" it while taking help from closed on - I realised with a help of a closed I need professional help to navigate further.

I am writing about this in public to share my reflections. In the hope that this helps someone in need.

Side observation: I love how therapists and counsellors have an unsaid rule if they are not able to to help - they always refer someone to you. No one goes empty handed, they try their best to help you. I wish people were like that in general. This unsaid morale and ethic is contagious.

## Therapy

I spoke about this first therapy episode with a school friend. He goes on to ask me - _Did it help?_

Asking this question is like checking your weight after day one at gym. The catch is - psychologically you feel fitter when you start working out and plan to continue to do so. 

That is exactly what it felt like.

### Realisations

- I felt lighter.

After the one hour session, I got up to pack my stuff and realised that something feel lighter. My head, my shoulders, my chest — which made me realise that there was something heavy that became a constant I never realised. 

- My feelings, thoughts and realisations feel more acknowledged and addressed.

- Action Items in mind.

There is a concept called RCA - [Root Cause Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis) in Software Engineering. 

I was able to identify and analyse the issue, the potential root cause and probably the solution as well. But i had difficulty in implementation. I needed refactoring in my belief system. 

Now that I am seeking professional help, I feel I have smaller, achievable action items in hand.

- I don't have to worry about it anymore.

Earlier the feelings kept flowing and popping up in my thoughts, potentially triggered me as well.

But now, the idea is that I can park aside my thoughts — because now I know I plan to address it in therapy.

### Fin

This is my first blog after I joined full time. It has been so diffcult to manage time and energy. 

But gladly, catching up with old friends, journalling my emotions about work, going to Yoga, a little untangling of thoughts and writing this blog — this is what the first week after therapy looked like. 

The conclusion is contrasting from the introductory context of this blog — the goal is not to "fix" anything, the goal is to regulate your emotions better.
