## Pre-requisites

- Always dress well.
- Make sure your clothes and footwear are comfortable.
    - If they are not comfortable, you will dread going to the workplace.
    - If you dress well and comfortably, you will enjoy your experiences even more.

Invest in it. Invest in yourself. It will be worth it!

- Ask senior leaderships (managers, project leads, etc) about what the goal is?
    - How many days?
    - What tasks?
    - What criteria will my performance be judged on?
        - Quality of work (Code Quality)
        - Time taken
        - Or just getting the work done
        - Test driven development?
        - Software Practices

Reminder: They don't expect anything out of freshers, you are an intern. This is not to hold you back or to get you a laid-back behaviour. This is just a disclaimer if you feel pressured.

## Unsolicited Advice starts here

- Asking questions: uncomfortable, unorthodox, questioning the system - to understand it and find potential flaws.
    - To who?
    - How many?
    - What kind?

- Being enthusiastic 
    - Even after a dreadful day

- Make sure you are squeezing out your day
    - You are short on time, the more you realize it, it's better.
    - In fact, my every introduction included: how much time I have been here.
        - "Tushar Nankani, it is my week 1 here"

Act like you are an employee on notice period, because you are!
