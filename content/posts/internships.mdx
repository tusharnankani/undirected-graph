### Context

In the summer of 2022, I had a chance to intern at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as a part of their Software Engineer Program. 

I have tried to compress all my learnings, observations and realizations in this log; things I would have done differently and things I would have done more. 

### Pre Advice

- Always dress well.

Why should you dress well? How does it matter? Won't I be judged on my work or the skills that I carry?

Believe it or not, first impressions matter. It may not be the last impression, but it is a lasting one.

Here is an excerpt from one of [my talks](http://talks.tusharnankani.com) on [Design Principles](https://talks.tusharnankani.com/design_principles). 

> The first impression is not just the last impression, it is the lasting impression. 
> 
> When it comes to apps, the first impression is created by aesthetics, not by value. 

It is true for people as well. At least for most of them; especially when you work in corporate.

> MIKE: What does it matter how much money I spend on suits?
> 
> HARVEY: People respond to how we're dressed so, like it or not, this is what you have to do.

Also, make sure your clothes and footwear are comfortable.
- If they are not comfortable, you will dread going to the workplace.
- If you dress well and comfortably, you will enjoy your experiences even more.
- Another side note, apply and carry perfume with you.

Invest in it. Invest in yourself. It will be worth it!

Reminder: They don't expect anything out of freshers or graduates, you are an intern. 

This is not to hold you back or to get you a laid-back behaviour. This is just a disclaimer if you feel pressured. (Also, [remember](https://blog.tusharnankani.com/posts/apply#:~:text=Apply%20to%20get,of%20the%20job%3F)).

## What did I work on?

During my internship, I worked on a frontend migration project. I was working with a frontend team of four and a product team of twelve.

We built a multi-page application interface for an internal tool of CIB (Corporate & Investment Banking) operations; migrating the tool from [Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs) to React.js (with Redux). We utilised the internal JPMC’s UI Toolkit.

In week 1, I was done with the tasks they had planned for me for the month. And as boastful as it sounds, I realized I was sitting for a LOT of time. I was just shipping.

#### Important Realization

Eventually, after a few realizations, I figured that I could code for the rest of the life, or learn whatever new tech-stack that is out there; but I might not get these weeks back, in the organization, with these people. 

I decided to make the most of it. To understand the organization, to understand how things are done at such a scale and hierarchy — with factors like communication, operations, code integrity in mind. In fact, the description for JPMC on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tusharnankani) still says —  Working 50 percent of the time; interacting with folks the other 50 percent of the time.

I used to observe, listen, ask, absorb and question whatever came to the mind. I noted them down, wherever accessible — Notes, Diary, et cetera.

Asynchronously, I used to block my colleagues', my manager's or my super-manager's calendars and discuss these observations and understand their thought process about it.

This iterative process helps you understand the system quickly.

Side Note: Always respect people's time. Be concise and to the point.

Over time, I realized that it was getting difficult for me to find a common time with my manager over the week. I wanted to communicate what I had been working on and what challenges I overcame. 

I started to email him at every week's end with:
- What I did in the week
- What challenges I overcame
- What I plan to do in the coming week

This exactly was the point in my life, where I understood the value of asynchronous communication.

## Unsolicited Advice

- Write your progress every day.

Work Logs are important: for (manager and peer) reviews, for resumes and to notice patterns about yourself.

Also, write about things that are hard to quantify: communication, coordination, reviews, proactivity.

I understood the value of these by reading: [Get your work recognized: write a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents), [Templates as Inspiration for Software Engineers and Engineering Managers](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/templates-as-inspiration-for-software-engineers/)

Plus, these helped me write those weekly emails effectively.

- Carry a notebook/diary.

To note down observations, questions, explanations, architectures, concepts, to-dos, et cetera.

These will later become a goldmine.

- Being enthusiastic 

Even after a dreadful day, try to push yourself. 

Test your limits. Go beyond your extremes.

I [previously wrote](https://blog.tusharnankani.com/posts/apply#:~:text=Applying%20for%20internships) about — 

> Interns are hired for their fresh opinions, the energy that they bring, and the naïveness at looking at a problem. Which is very important.
> 
> With experience, we start self rejecting ideas based on the merit in our "thought". There's no rose without a thorn.
> 
> However, being an intern/having a rookie mentality gets you to experiment with things — exploring things.
> 
> The free nature of this ideology is something a lot of firms leverage. Leads to creation of new ideas. New solutions.

- Make sure you are squeezing out your day.

You are short on time, the more you realize it, it's better.

In fact, my every introduction included: how much time I have been here. 

"Hey, it is my week 1 here." — A very simple icebreaker.

- Interact with all kinds of people. 

I am still in contact with not just full-time engineers and VPs, but also analysts, CAs, CFAs. 

Be curious about other teams and projects. It helps with exposure and a better understanding of the bigger picture.

#### Saving the best for the last

**Asking questions**

Questions that may be uncomfortable, unorthodox, questioning the system - to understand it and find potential flaws.

Important: Do not take — "This is how we have been doing it" as an answer.

What kind of questions?

- About the Role
    - What does a typical day/week look like in this role? 
    - What's the junior/senior balance of the team? 
    - How much freedom for decision making do individual developers have? 
- About Tech
    - What are the usual stacks used at the company?
    - How do you use source control? 
    - How do you test code? 
    - How do you track bugs? 
- From potential coworkers
    - Who do developers tend to learn from?
    - What do you like best about working there?
    - What do you like least?
    - What would you change if you could?
- About the Company
    - How are requirements/expectations communicated? What is the hierarchy like?
    - What does it mean to be successful here, and how do you measure success?
    - What's the promotion process? 
- Decisions during Conflicts
    - How are differences of opinions resolved?
    - What happens after pushback? ("this can't be done in the projected time")
    - What happens when the team is under pressure and commits to work over their capacity/velocity?

Sky is the limit.

## Fin

Tinker around, keep exploring.

Act like you are an employee on notice period, because you are!
