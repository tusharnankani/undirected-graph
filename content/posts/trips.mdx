### Context

The advice I kept recieving when I left JPMC is — Spend time in college, spend time with your friends. Enjoy while it "lasts".

> Job is for next many years. College only for few days more. 
> 
> <cite>Darshan Jani, JPMC (My first manager)</cite>

Sub-consciously I often remind this to myself, in my final semester of college. 

For some reason, my instinct/feeling for a potential plan, for most of the times, was — hesitation. I never questioned it. But now, I have been asking myself — What is there to lose? Money? Time? 

But aren't these the things we have to give in to make an experience worth it? For life to be worth living.

### Detour 

As much as the "fun" part of friendships sound shiny, I want to invest in deeper relations and conversations that makes one think on an intellectual and emotional level. To discuss observations and perspectives, with whom one can delve into a soul-like dimension. Thinking and speaking passionately about ideas with logic, acknowledged flawed emotions and irrational biases.

I call these people intellectual sparring partners. (The term is [borrowed from Sahil Bloom](www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/intellectual-sparring-partners).)

I have been investing my time, my final few days in college with such people. Speaking with people. Understanding them. And potentially influencing their opinions or/and shaping my judgements.

This mutual ideology have led a bunch of us to go on these — One Day Trips. (The "one day trips" ideology comes from the fact of not going on a long, far, multiple days' trip. Instead, exploring local nearby places, food and people.)

## One Day Trips

The overflow of the different kind of places, thoughts, observations, food and people have pushed me to log it. (For me to keep a track frankly.)

Here's an ongoing list from the past few weeks: 

- Colaba, Churchgate, Marine Lines
- Ghatkopar
- Seawoods (Pranav)
- Kalyan, Ulhasnagar (Rishika, Chirag, Vanshika)
- Haji-ali, Sardar, Palladium
- Virar (Shruti)
- Dadar (Dheeraj Da Dhaba)
- King's Circle (Mani's Dosa)
- Dalal street, Churchgate
- Dadar (Aswaad)
- Borivali - Virar Thrill

## Observations

Everytime we went to some friend's house, I felt so warm. As if I already knew them. Speaking to them felt like there is already a pre-exisiting relationship. 

Made me think — Why did I feel pressured for people to come to my house or meet my parents? Turns out the pressure is just in the head.

People are kind. Kinder than I thought the world to be.
