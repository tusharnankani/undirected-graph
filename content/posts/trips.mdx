### Context

One advice I kept recieving when I left JPMC is — Spend time in college, spend time with your friends. Enjoy while it lasts.

> Job is for next many years. College only for few days more. 
> 
> <cite>Darshan Jani, JPMC (My first manager)</cite>

Sub-consciously I often remind myself this in my final semester of college. 

My instinct for a potential plans was always some hesitation. I never questioned it, but now I have been asking — What's there to lose? Money? Time? 

But aren't these the things you have to give in to make an experience worth it? For life to be worth living.

### A detour 

And as much as the "fun" part of friendships sound shiny, I want to invest in deeper conversations that makes me think on an intellectual and emotional level. To discuss observations and perspectives, with whom one can delve into a soul-like dimension. Thinking and speaking passionately about ideas with logic, acknowledged flawed emotions and irrational biases.

I call these people intellectual sparring partners. (The term is [borrowed from Sahil Bloom](www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/intellectual-sparring-partners).)

I have been investing my time, my final few days in college with such people. Speaking with people. Understanding them. And potentially influencing their opinions or/and shaping my judgements.

These have led to a lot of One Day Trips. (The "one day trips" ideology comes from the fact of not going on a long, far, multiple day trips. And exploring local nearby places, food)

The overflow of the different kind of places, thoughts, observations, food and people have pushed me to log it. For me to keep a track frankly.
