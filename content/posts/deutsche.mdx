In this one, I narrate my interview experience. But with that, how this was an eye-opening, unorthodox experience filled with insane amount of realizations that could help your next interview.

### Context

I have had interesting encounters with Deutsche Bank.

In the summer of 2022, exactly one year ago, I interviewed for [Deutsche Bank](https://www.deutschebank.co.in/en/about-us.html) for their full-time engineering role.

At the time, I was interning at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as a Software Engineering Intern. If you are curious, you should read how I tried to [make the most out of my internship](https://blog.tusharnankani.com/posts/internships).

### Structure

- Programming Assessment (3 problems)
- In-person Interviews (4 rounds)

## Programming Assessment

The test consists of 3 DSA problems for full-time employees. The diffculty was increasing in nature — Easy, Medium, Hard. (Yes, this is subjective; but assume [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) Easy, Medium, Hard.)

I was able to solve one and the second one partially. Third one felt a little out of scope.

A good aim should be to solve the first two. Try everything, naïve approaches, brute-force. Partially solve it and try to maximize your score. 

#### For Internship

The year before that when I applied for the internship at Deutsche Bank, there were 2 DSA problems and 10 multiple-choice questions around Core CS — Database Management System (DBMS), Operating System (OS), Computer Networking (CN).

[Suggestions to make it through](https://blog.tusharnankani.com/posts/jpmc-interview#:~:text=is%20like%20that.-,So%20where%20to%20go%3F,-There%202%20kinds).

## Interview Rounds

I was shortlisted for the in-person interviews.

### Detour

I gave the test when I was half-way into my internship, however my interviews were scheduled in the last few weeks of my internship. At that point, I had certain confidence that JPMC will extend a full-time offer.

After I assembled a list of Pros and Cons, I realised that I would want to choose JPMC between the two organisations. Multiple factors taken into account here, and that could be yet another story. Broadly the factors were culture, my internship experience, and location. If you want to discuss more about this, [let's talk](http://about.tusharnankani.com).

Now that I know what I want, I could either choose to bomb the interviews and got out of these rounds. Or give my best, gain interviewing experience and have an option to make a call at the end, dicsussing with the recruiters. 

I decided to give my best shot.

But the catch here was — There was nothing to lose. I wasn't worried about the end results. And the results were insane. 

During the day of interviews, I was very relieved and did not feel butterflies in my gut. I could speak naturally.

I was confident and I could feel a fresh breeze in the body. Everything was different. I felt I was myself for the first time during the interviews — brutally honest.

## Round One — Technical

- Introduction
- Around your Résumé
- Basic DSA
- Core CS
- Puzzles
- Guesstimates

Tell me about yourself. 

This will be asked in almost every round. Super cliché question, but you answer need not be.

Structure your introduction before hand.

1. List down broad points you want to mention to give an "holistic" profile.
2. Filter it and connect the dots (for continuity between context switches). 
3. Make it crisp and under one minute. 
4. Give them clear threads of information.

These threads have to be your strong points. Post which, the interviewer can climb on any one of them. 

And it can be genralised for all answers and that is precisely how you drive the interview in your favour.

#### Introduction

Here, I decided to experiment. Remember: I had nothing to lose. I made the most of this opportunity.

I always wanted to say — "You have my résumé infront of you. So, I will tell you something outside of this."

Of course, I chose gentler words but I did so. 

I spoke about my community work, open-source, curiousity in UI/UX, experimentations with the Web. Then, I phased into projects and mentioned the spectrum — Web Apps, Scripts, Data Analysis Tools, Command-line utilities, Chrome extensions.

Observe here. Count the number of threads I am leaving for the interviewer to jump on.

Side thought: Imagine yourself as the interviewer. You would pick up the thread you know well or the one you are curious about. That makes it fun for the other side as well.

So, the interviewer asked me about one of my Data Analysis projects and what was I building for my final year project. Further, he asked me more about my internship work at JPMC and my Position of Responsibility in one of the college coding committees.

#### Basic DSA

First, I was asked about a simple LinkedList question, with additional variation of cyclic LinkedList with the solution being the two-pointer approach.

Next, I was asked a standard Dynamic Programming Problem of an n*m matrix around probability.

#### Core CS

I was asked if I knew Java. I wasn't very comfortable with Java. I could have said this, but speak strategically. Do not use negative connotations. 

I responded — I studied the language as a part of OOPS core subject in my third semester. I am well-versed with C++ as I prefer that in Competitive Programming and JavaScript as I have had experience building interfaces with React.

**Note**: Observe here. 

Post this, I was just asked about OOPS, Classes and Object. I explained with enough analogies and real-time examples.

Surprisingly, the interview took a turn here. I was being asked questions around React.js, the Virtual DOM and the Diffing Algorithm. I comfortably answered those, I turned the interview into my niché.

#### Puzzles

These were SO much fun. I never knew these were asked in interviews.

Apparently, my batchmates prepared for a bunch of these online and later I found mine as well.

I was asked the [Two Dice](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-23-days-of-month-using-2-dice) and [Fill the Vertices in the Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fill-grid-1-8-numbers). I was asked to write the psuedocode for the latter.

Find [more puzzles](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-100-puzzles-asked-in-interviews). You do not need to prepare for them. They are fun and it's like solving together.

The interviewer is your friend, your colleague. What I believe they are looking for is clear communication of your logical thought process. 

Be vocal.

#### Guesstimates

This was another surprise, but I loved it. Hear me out.

"Tell me your favourite fast food joint"

I froze. 

I did not know what was going to be the follow-up question. I was silent. I started subtly smiling as he waited for the answer.

I said — The Serial Griller. I went there last month.

"What is the yearly turnover for this restaurant?"

My smile widened as the confusion peaked. I did not understand the motive. 

I took a step back and started from scratch. 

I started explaining my thought process. Range of burger costs. Average Cost per burger. Seating area. Average customers per day. Competitive food joints in the same line. Average orders on a weekday and weekend. Average turnover for a week. 

As I was going to mutliply to find the yearly turnover, I remembered I forgot to take into account online orders. I told this out loud. And as I remembered this fact, I realized why this question was asked — 

To see how **broadly** we can think. 

I narrated this observation to him as well — "Oh, now it all makes sense". He smirked.

#### Conclusion

The interview was concluded by asking the controversial question — If I get the offer from JPMC, and we give you the offer too; what would you choose?

I knew this was coming, I had my answer ready. I gave my logic behind choosing JPMC.

Now, as I waited for my rejection from further rounds and my day to get over — I was called in for the further rounds.
