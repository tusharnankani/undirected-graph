Here is an incomplete list of reflections derived from the observations from the protagonist of the infamous movie — Laal Singh Chaddha. A bollywood remake of Forrest Gump.

- Be a good storyteller.
- Always listen to your mother.
- Always have a child-like innocent mind.
- Show up for the people who you love.
- Having a naïve way to look helps avoid certain thoughts that drain mental peace.
- Help your friends reach their goal.
- Help everyone who asks for help, thanklessly.
- Give your supposed enemy the benefit of doubt.
- Say _Aaho_ (Yes) to every opportunity.
- Love is eternal and unconditional.

This movie makes me feel emotional, mushy and makes me want to do good in life. This is a movie that I would want to keep watching to remind me what to be and what not to be.
