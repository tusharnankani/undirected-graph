Humans coherently love to make patterns to account for and validate their conclusions. However, this is a creative hypothesis for some day later. 

Today, let us look at a subtle micro-interaction: [patternistic](https://tusharnankani.github.io/patternistic) â€” a small case study on how even the tiniest details matter.

## Context

I was playing around with animations the week before I built patternistic. During that period, I built [Resonating Circles](https://tusharnankani.github.io/resonating-circles).

Here, I implemented basic and raw animations, transitions and transformation with a little interactivity. This was a highly iterative process. I first created new circles in the center with no interaction. Then, onClick create in the center - a little interaction. Furthermore, creating circles onClick on those specific coordinates.

In the coming week, I saw a pattern on social media and I thought to build a tool that creates those patterns. However, patternisitc is no where close to what I thought I had in mind, but some beautiful experiences take place with no expectations in mind. So, here we go. 

## patternistic

Users love to interact. Interaction is fundamentally a contiguous response or feedback on user interaction. In Resonating Circles, the interaction was onClick. There _some_ friction. 

Hereby, I chose to increase the level of interactivity, by responding to the user on onHover.

I decided to play with animations to make some trailing patterns (low-key always wanted to do this) and here's what the [base code to create elements](https://github.com/tusharnankani/resonating-circles/blob/38d75938ac2234766820c9a5869616f4bbca2fe4/script.js#L8-L18) looked like:

```javascript
createNewCircle = (x = window.innerWidth / 2, y = window.innerHeight / 2) => {
    let newCircle = document.createElement('div');
    newCircle.classList.add(`circle`, `circle-${GLOBAL_COUNTER++}`);

    /* set the orginating circle from x and y coordinate */
    newCircle.style.setProperty('top', `calc(${y}px - ${CIRCLE_DIAMETER / 2}rem`);
    newCircle.style.setProperty('left', `calc(${x}px - ${CIRCLE_DIAMETER / 2}rem`);

    body.appendChild(newCircle);
    setTimeout(() => body.removeChild(newCircle), ANIMATION_TIME_PER_CIRCLE);
}
```

### Zooming Out

These experiments (or let's call them "case studies" to sound cool) were started with a blank canvas, with absolutely nothing but a broad topic or outline in mind. Rest was hit and trial. Experimenting, rather exploring like a kid. An iterative procedure until you get some satisfaction from what's infront of you. It was surprisingly yet extremely fulfilling. Like looking at someone learn how to walk.
