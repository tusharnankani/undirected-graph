I am scared.

I am scared about a lot of things. A lot of things that I am scared to admit. But let's do the things we are scared about.

I am scared of the person I might become that I consciously or sub-consciously decided not to be.

I am scared about being even slightly in the comfortable zone. It is a slippery slope, it is not the end of the world, sure. But it takes time and is difficult to get out of it some days. I hope I am able to.

I am scared to not being able to put things into action. Be it learning or implementing. 

I am scared to get sucked into the instant gratification by consuming content I should not. I scared to get addicted to temporary satisfaction/feelings. I am scared to get addicted to the dopamine by taking the greedy route in every situation. Because I think I already am. I want to read more books, I want to understand concepts deeply, I want to learn more about the things I am passionate about. I hope I am able to.

I am scared about the regret — not making the first move, not approaching people, not complimenting people. This regret starts adding a void temporarily, starts eating you up. Until you just learn to live with it.

I am scared about not adding value — in people's lives, in my life. (Side realization: It's ironic how most people are worried about if they will be able to speak or fumble while speaking and less worried about if they will be able to add value while speaking.) 

I am scared of not being healthy. I am scared to not break sweat. I am scared to not eat healthy, not have nutrients.

I am scared to not care about the people who care about me. I am scared if I hurt someone and I am not able to identify it. I hope I am able to make things right. I hope I am able to get another chance, because there are times when we do not.

I am scared to feel lonely. Loneliness is the price one has to pay for freedom. I feel it is coming soon. I hope I am able to handle it.

I hope I am able to make the ideal decisions. And even if not, I hope I have the energy and will to live with it. 
I hope I am able to get up and dust myself up. And still be able to live with myself.

I hope I live a fulfilled life.
