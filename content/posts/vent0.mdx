## Context

This was an awful, toxic morning.
I have never heard so much BS in one day, more like in 2 hours.

Need a month to process this, fr.

We had a placement session introduction. Went on for 145 minutes, and got worse with every passing minute.

Why am I writing this? 

I need to vent out. I need an escape. I need to talk about this.

<sub>This will be deleted soon, I don't want snitches to take this to the placement cell ðŸ¥°</sub>

## Begins

Starts with someone throwing random buzzwords around for 30 straight minutes, making absolutely zero sense.

Example. Talking about Quantum Computing, making GUIs from Java and Python did not make sense.

Recieving messages like this an eye opener enough:

> Sir motivate kar rahe hai ki demotivate 

> basically hume kuch nahi aata, 4 mahine mein sab seekh lo
 
> NPTEL, Coursera, Udacity ko chaat lo, expert ban jao.
 
> Bakwaas karte rehna chahiye, mann laga rehata hai. 

Last one was a real killer.

### Real placement talk

This had a real sensible start.

Actually talking about "Why should you even listen to me?" - is something very important to build credibilty.

So, the credibility and respect started building; and right after it. It was bashed with a shit ass analogy.

Comparing the salary of 3.5 lacs with 35 lacs. 

Comparing driving a Chiron, with riding a cycle. 

Fuck.

I don't have problem with what they are selling. 
I have problem with **how** they are selling.

Creating shit load of fomo, even a skilled person lose confidence after hearing such people.

Comparing salaries, talking about off campus achievements as on-campus, was a red flag.
And that's when I lost it.

### Selling Trainings

This was triggering. Had me feeling like shit.

The first guy was "real talk alert" but.

> Basic human decency nahi hai inme

> This is fucking horrible

`"Maal", "Gareebi", "Aukaat"`

They were not selling trainings, they were selling fear.

To be or, not to be? I don't know what I will be a few years down the line, but now I know who I will not be.

Note to self: Never sell your products, by playing with fear.

I have never loved this so much, thanks <3

### What do I have a problem with?

Rather than creating fear and FOMO. 
Talking about real things, like passion, common love about tech, answering genuine questions.

I understand they want to maintain the stats of "100% people getting placed". But there are other ways.

Sure, the other strategy works on a lot. This was an eye opener. A reality check.

I fucking very well know that after this, a lot of people will create Leetcode, Codechef account and will start doing DSA and CP without the interest for it. 

> facts aaj ke din se hi 80% janta hackerrank/leetcode/cf etc pe account bana ne lagegi

Happens a lot in India. Nothing new.

## Fin

> I left the meeting. Ah mental peaceðŸ¥°

This was too mentally exhausting. Thanks to the people who were venting with me on chat <3

Talk. Talk to people about what you are feeling. Shoot me a messaage, and we'll talk on call. 

My final thoughts are: 

Shit was always real. We have realized it now.

Don't lose hope. Take them if you want, out of FOMO, out of fear, or out of less preparation. 

Be scared. Because that's the first step. 

But don't lose self confidence. 

A smile goes a long way.
