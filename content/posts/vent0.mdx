## Context

This was an awful, toxic morning.
I have never heard so much BS in one day, more like in 2 hours.

Need a month to process this, fr.

We had a placement session introduction. Went on for 145 minutes, and got worse with every passing minute.

Why am I writing this? 

I need to vent out. I need an escape. I need to talk about this.

<sub>This will be deleted soon, I don't want snitches to take this to the placement cell ðŸ¥°</sub>

Edit: I have chosen to own this. I am not defaming anyone or any organization, I have never taken any names. These are purely my observations and my feelings. 

And after the kind of DMs I recieved, I felt it would do more good, than the opposite. I would never delete this. I encourage everyone to share this and speak about their feelings. 

## Begins

Starts with someone throwing random buzzwords around for 30 straight minutes, making absolutely zero sense.

Example. Talking about Quantum Computing, making GUIs from Java and Python did not make sense.

Recieving messages like this an eye opener enough:

> Sir motivate kar rahe hai ki demotivate 

> basically hume kuch nahi aata, 4 mahine mein sab seekh lo
 
> NPTEL, Coursera, Udacity ko chaat lo, expert ban jao.
 
> Bakwaas karte rehna chahiye, mann laga rehata hai. 

Last one was a real killer.

### Real placement talk

This had a real sensible start.

Actually talking about "Why should you even listen to me?" - is something very important to build credibilty.

So, the credibility and respect started building; and right after it â€” It was bashed with a shit ass analogy.

Comparing the salary of 3.5 lacs with 35 lacs. 

Comparing driving a Chiron, with riding a cycle. 

Fuck.

I don't have problem with **what** they are selling. 
I have problem with **how** they are selling.

Creating shit load of fomo, that even a skilled person would lose confidence after hearing this kind of mindset.

Talking about off campus achievements as on-campus, was a bloody red flag.

And that's when I lost it.

### Selling Trainings

This was triggering. Had me feeling like shit.

The first guy was "real talk alert" but.

> Basic human decency nahi hai inme

> This is fucking horrible

`"Maal", "Gareebi", "Aukaat"`

They were not selling trainings, they were selling fear.

To be or, not to be? I don't know what I will be a few years down the line, but I know what I will not be.

Note to self: Never sell your product, by playing with fear.

I have never loved this so much, thanks <3

### What do I have a problem with?

Rather than creating fear and FOMO. 
Talking about real things, like passion, common love about tech, answering genuine questions.

I understand they want to maintain the stats of "100% people getting placed". But there are other ways, too.

Sure, the other strategy works a lot. 

I fucking very well know that after this, a lot of people will create Leetcode, Codechef accounts and will start doing DSA and CP without the interest for it.

Happens a lot in India. Nothing new.

And as for people struggling with FOMO, a friend shared this:

> We don't reach the level of our expectations, we reach the level of our training.

## Fin

This was too mentally exhausting. Thanks to the people who were venting with me on chat <3

> I left the meeting. Ah mental peaceðŸ¥°

Talk. Talk to people about what you are feeling. Shoot me a message, and we'll talk on call. 

My final thoughts are: 

Shit was always real. We have realized it now.

This was an eye opener. A reality check.

So, don't lose hope. Take the trainings if you want to - out of FOMO, out of fear, or out of less preparation. Take it, but don't regret later. 

Be scared. Because that's the first step. 

But don't lose self confidence. 

And smile. Because a smile goes a long way.
