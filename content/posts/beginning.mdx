This was very long awaited. I wanted to write/build a blog since the past one year.

### Why the delay? 

My need to making everything perfect. Perfect ideas, perfect template, the perfect blog name.  

And as [one](https://twitter.com/DeepankarBhade) of my friends said while building [his portfolio](https://dpnkr.in):

> This site would never be completed and would always be a work in progress just like Life is :)

So this is a WIP and so am I.

And thankful to [Harsh Kapadia](https://harshkapadia.me) for the push to _just_ start writing and to start shipping it. And a billion other things.


### Why start now?

My wanting to write has become a need now — to align my line of thoughts and to keep a track of what I think. And that is the sole reason. I am writing for myself. (Also maybe, something to do with the new year resolution :P)

### Write what? 

Ideas. Thoughts. Feelings. Discoveries. Observations. 

Both tech related and non-tech related. About my experiences, about building things, about breaking things, about the human nature, about open-source, about finance, about new technologies, about mental health, about random project ideas, about different perspectives.

## Undirected Graph

The overload of ideas has pushed me to connect the dots, analogous to my connected thoughts forming a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) - **Undirected Graph**.

I love solving problems - and the data structure I most resonated while writing was an `undirected graph`. Of course, the name for the blog didn't just pop up, it was inspired by [orderdlist](https://orderedlist.com) by [steve smith](https://twitter.com/orderedlist).

### Fin.

So here we go — bring me to the end (or **The Beginning**?). 
Let's see where this takes me!
