### Styling pages by a customized theme

All source codes related to the blog are under [components](/src/components) and [pages](/src/pages) directory.
You can modify it freely if you want to apply your design theme.
All components use [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) and [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) to define their styles, but you can choose any styling libraries for designing your theme.

The directory tree containing the blog source code are described below:

```
meta: yaml files defining metadata like authors or tags
public: images, favicons and other static assets
src
├── assets: other assets using inside of components
├── components: pieces of components consisting of pages
├── content: mdx files for each post page
├── lib: project libraries like data fetching or pagination
└── pages: page components managing by Next.js
```
